# **Week 1 Quiz - Introduction to deep learning**
## **This is only my answer for quiz 2: 100% correct**
1. **Which of the following are some aspects in which AI has transformed business?**
    + Web searching and advertisement : AI has helped to make a fit between services or results and consumers or queries.
2. **Which of the following are reasons that didn't allow Deep Learning to be developed during the '80s?**
    + Interesting applications such as image recognition require large amounts of data that were not available: Many resources used today to train Deep Learning projects come from the fact that our society digitizes almost everything, creating a large dataset to train Deep Learning models.
    +  Limited computation power: Yes. Deep Learning methods need a lot of computational power, and only recently the use of GPUs has accelerated the experimentation with Deep Learning.
3. **Recall the diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the stages shown in the diagram was improved with the use of a better GPU/CPU?**
    + Experiments finis faster, producing better ideas through increased iteration tempo: Yes. The experiments help to test ideas, by getting the feedback from the experiments new variations can be tested and the results might indicate new directions to explore.
    + Some algorithm are specifically designed to run experiments faster: Yes. Some algorithms look specifically to improve the time needed to run an experiment and thus enable us to produce better models.
4. **When experienced deep learning engineers work on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?**
    + False: Finding the characteristics of a model is key to having good performance. Although experience can help, it requires multiple iterations to build a good model.
5. **Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?**
    + [This link](https://www.google.com/search?q=relu+function&sxsrf=ALiCzsYsnQ9pIFNZmnyf0_BKboZb2BCleg:1660241181783&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiHpIavsL_5AhUNp4sKHaXcB0gQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1856&bih=980&dpr=1#imgrc=GTtj5UfQ4xTfGM)
6. **Which of the following are examples of unstructured data? Choose all that apply.**
    + Image for bird recognition 
    + Text describing size and number of pages of book
    + Sound files for speech recognition
7. **A dataset is composed of age and weight data for several people. This dataset is an example of "structured" data because it is represented as an array in a computer. True/False?**
    + **True**:  the sequences can be represented as arrays in a computer. This is an example of structured data.
8. **Why can an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) be used to create English captions to French movies? Choose all that apply.**
    + The RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is applicable since the input and output of the problems are sequences
    + It can be trained as a supervised learning problem
9. **From the given diagram, we can deduce that Large NN models are always better than traditional learning algorithms. True/False?**
    + False: when the amount of data is not large the performance of traditional learning algorithms is shown to be the same as NN
10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)

    + Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
    + Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
